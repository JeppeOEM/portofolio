          A concept prototype of an accounting tool targeting young people with part time jobs.
          
          The app offers an easy way to track how many kilomets they drive and a way to scan directly or upload paychecks
          to automate the calculations of what you need to fill on your tax report.
          This project consisted of a fully developed buisness proposal. 
          
          First thing was to know our users, so we did interviews to find and get to know our users and aswells as tests to increase usability.
          Furthermore we developed both a social media strategy trying to convey our message to a young audidience who speak a completly diffrent
          language than financial apps normally use.
          This made me use my full potiental as a aspiring multimedia designer, as my work consisted both in developing the tests and the identity of the brand through the design of social media content, as seen below, 
          aswell as using my knowledge of API's and hosting to resarch the feasability of the project as a buisness in regards to both subjects 
          as organising the actual coding of the project.
